## Project Description
Analysis of the data set called "Global Sharks Attacks" through data wrangling, cleaning and manipulation with Pandas.
The questions to be answered after the data cleaning are:
- Has the month with more attacks changed since 1800?
- Has the season with more attacks changed since 1800?

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization

1. Create th repository with .gitignore file and README.md
2. Examine the data, trying to understand what each field meant
3. Delete the fields not link to the main questions
4. Clean and process the rest of the data

### This repository is organized as follows:
- Folder called Data: includes the initial CSV file and the output csv after the cleaning process
- Jupyter notebook called data-wrangling.ipynb: includes all the steps done
