# Guided Project: Demonstration of Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

For this project I started reviewing the lessons about Pandas to reinforce concepts. I also watch some Youtube videos about Data Cleaning and read some papers. 

Then I thought about the question I wanted to answer with my project, trying to cover as much as the concepts covered in class. 

In the beggining it was hard for me to see clearly the data I wanted to clean, and I started cleaning columns that I wouldn't use later. 


## Content

I am delivering the data wrangling file (data-wrangling.ipynb), the raw attacks csv file, and the 3 other csv related to the dataframes I used in the project (attacks_cleaned, attacks_year, attacks_area_year and attacks_area) and the slides I used for the presentation.
