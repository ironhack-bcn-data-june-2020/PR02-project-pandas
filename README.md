# Guided Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

- I import all the tools that I think I will use during the project.
-Import the CSV and drop some columns and change some name of the column.
-I replaced the NaN values for "No Info".
-I cleaned all the columns that I am going to use to answer the questing that I will formulate.
-I developed the question.

The most difficult part for me was to create a pivot tablet or cross table. I tried, but I could not mix the data to create a proper one
