# Guided Project: Demonstration of Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

For this project I cleaned all data that I did not need for responding with country has the most fatal victims since they started recolecting data. 

I used several tutorials on YouTube and spoke to a few freinds trying to make the best out of it. I tryed to use every funtion seen in class. 

I started with no quastion, because I did not know how far I could go. 

## Final product

I finished the project with a CSV with the top 5 by country of fatal victims.
